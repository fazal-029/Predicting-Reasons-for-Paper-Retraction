# Predicting-Reasons-for-Paper-Retraction
Retraction of a published paper means that the original paper should not have been published and its data or conclusion should not be used in other research. The goal of this project is to create a model that takes the abstract of a retracted paper and outputs either 0 (indicating retraction for author error) or 1 (indicating retraction for fraud).
